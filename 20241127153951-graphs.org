* Graphs

Models a set of connections.

It is made up of /nodes/ and /edges/.

Nodes has:
- /in-neighbors/: pointing to a neighbor
- /out-neighbor/: being pointed at

* Implementation

We can implement graphs by using a hash table since each node has a relationship/connection with another node.

#+begin_src python
  graph = {}
  # starting point of "you" points to the first degree connections arranged in an array
  graph["you"] = ["alice", "bob", "claire"]

  # each 1st degree connection points to their corresponding out-neighbor in an array
  graph["bob"] = ["anuj", "peggy"]
  graph["alice"] = ["peggy"]
  graph["claire"] = ["thom", "jonny"]

  # 2nd degree connection does not point to anyone signifying the end of the graph
  graph["anuj"] = []
  graph["peggy"] = []
  graph["thom"] = []
  graph["jonny"] = []
